# .github

This project is planned to be open-sourced, so that vision/color science researchers and enthusiasts can interact with vision science objects with ease. It's designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, so that new algorithms and vision science objects could be generated if desired.

Note that the initial first commit of each repository (frontend, backend, theory) comes from this [original repository linked here](https://github.com/Zackoon/ObjectColorSolidRenderer).
